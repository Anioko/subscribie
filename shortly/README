# Setup 

### Create database
python createdb.py

### Create .env file
Example .env file: 
export success_redirect_url=http://localhost:5000/complete_mandate
export thankyou_url=http://localhost:5000/thankyou
export db_full_path=./karma.db

### Run the script locally

`sudo python shortly.py`

Note: On the server, the app is presented as a wsgi application which apache loads in
see: http://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/quick-configuration-guide.html 
(looks more complicated that it is)
