Broadband availability checker.

# Goals
- Automate customer acquisition of broadband customers
- Availability checker 
- Payment collection (direct debit mandate)
- Customer infor collection & storage 
- Anything else?

^ Not necessarily in that order!

# Supporting goals
- PWA (Progressive web app) should work offline (except when lookup is performed, obviously)


- Started out as a Werkzeug tutorial when learning Werkzeug, so lots of cruft to remove

Environment: 

- Install python
- Install Werkzeug
- Inatall jinja2, bs4

#How to run
`cd shortly`
`sudo python shortly.py`
